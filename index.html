            <h4>GURU HARKRISHAN PUBLIC SCHOOL INDIA GATE is a progressive English Medium Co-educational Senior Secondary. School affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). Referred to as the ‘Mother School’ of all Guru Harkrishan Public Schools, it is the first school to be established in 1965 by Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee with an aim to impart quality education and establish positive attitude amongst children in an enlightened environment, imbibing ethos and ethics of Sikhism.

            <h4>Established in 1965, Guru Harkrishan Public School India Gate, has always strived to impart Value Based Education
                maintaining the equilibrium between academics and cocurricular activities. We endeavor to navigate through the perilous path of modern day education without ignoring our rich culture. Our curriculum aims at providing space to children to recognize their innate potential and realize the vision of excellence in every venture. The primary purpose of education at GHPS India Gate is not to teach how to earn bread but how to make living worthwhile and meaningful. The aim of education should be to teach rather how to think, than what to think - rather to improve our minds, so as to enable us to think for ourselves, than to load the memory with thoughts of other men. The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows. The goal calls for better and more possibilities to support young children, and their families and communities, in all the areas where the child is growing physically, emotionally, socially and intellectually.</h4>

            <h4>GHPS India Gate has a rewarding history of achievements both academically & culturally. Our school pursues academic excellence with a view to instill youthful and vulnerable minds with the belief that children of today will be leaders of tomorrow.
                It is my deep conviction that academic wisdom, ideology and teachings of our gurus will go a long way in making our students truthful and responsible individuals and in retaining the glory of our institution. Our aim is to empower our students to be academically brilliant and humble, compassionate, responsible and thus become a holistic individual with an aim to transform their potential into reality.
                We will continue to move forward together with confidence, pride and enthusiasm. Our passionate teachers ensure that our students grow their confidence and capabilities and develop the skills for this rapidly changing 21st century. Parents are the strengthening power of any institution, their involvement, support and active participation enhances the quality of education. Education is a shared commitment between dedicated teachers, motivated students and enthusiastic parents with high expectations.

                May the true education carry the message of serenity and humility.
